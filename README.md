Test Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

## Algorithms
- PoWER
- Simple Policy Gradient
- SARSA (discrete)
- Q-learning (discrete)
- TDLearning (discrete)

## Worlds
- Cart pole world
- Mountain car world
- Simple maze world (discrete)
- Cliff world (discrete)
- Adapter world (a continuous world that can be instantiated with a discrete
  world. With One-hot coding, algorithms for continuous worlds can work on
  discrete worlds.)
